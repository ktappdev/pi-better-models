/**
 * Per-instance idempotency guard for extension activation.
 *
 * A meta-package that bundles this extension invokes its factory, and a standalone
 * install makes Pi invoke it again — sometimes against the SAME `pi`. We must
 * dedupe that. But Pi rebuilds the extension runtime on /new, /resume, /fork,
 * and /reload, handing the factory a BRAND-NEW `pi`; that must re-register.
 *
 * Keying the registry on the `pi` instance satisfies both: same instance =>
 * skip, new instance => run. The registry lives on globalThis because jiti
 * (`moduleCache: false`) re-evaluates this module on every load pass, so a
 * module-scoped WeakMap would not be shared between the aggregator pass and the
 * standalone pass within a single session.
